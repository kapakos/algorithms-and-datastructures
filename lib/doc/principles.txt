1 Customer Obsession

Example 1:
A couple of months back we did a redesign of the activity page. It's the page at american express where our customers can look up their
transactions, check their balances, their statements etc. We realized that our customers where dissatisfied with how we rearanged functional 
components on our page and where very vocal about it.
I was the tech lead of the activity team and my job was the implementation of all the new features on the activity pages. So the question now 
was, should we keep implementing new features or should we address the issues our customers are facing with the redesign of the page.
So I reached out to the team that consolidates the customer feedback and I asked them what where the top 5 complaints about our page. Since I 
know the features of the page very well, I try to identify 3 items that could be fixed in a timely manner while getting the highest return of investment.
The result of this was that we identified 3 items, fixed these together with the UX team and after that we saw that the negative customer feedback decreased 60%
